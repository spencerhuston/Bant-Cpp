### Arithmetic Operations
Bant supports primitive integer types, with the following operations:
- Addition ```+```
- Subtraction ```-```
- Multiplication ```*```
- Division ```/```
- Modulus ```%```

Regular operator precedence follows, with use of parentheses available to break it up.

Examples:

```
printInt(1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5)
``` 
=> ```1```

<br>

```
printInt((1 + (2 - 3)) * 4 / 5)
``` 
=> ```0```
