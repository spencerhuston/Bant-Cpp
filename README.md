# Bant
Bant is an interpreted, statically typed, toy functional programming language made purely for my own entertainment

### Build:
Simply clone and run ```make```. Run using ```[bant directory]/build/bant [source file name].bnt```

### Features:
- first-class functions
- closures
- partial function application
- generic function parameters
- algebraic data types as _typeclass_ [Type]
- _int_, _char_, _string_, _bool_, and _null_ primitive types
- standard arithmetic and boolean operations
- _List_ type
- _Tuple_ type
- builtin functions for: _List_ manipulation, basic I/O
- control-flow statements
- pattern matching by value
- static type-checking
- comments
- external file importing

### TODO:
- Finish built in functions
- Implement better system for generics
