# Bant
Bant is an interpreted, statically typed, toy functional programming language made purely for my own entertainment

### Build:
Simply clone and run the ```makeBant.sh``` script. Run a Bant program using ```[bant directory]/build/bant source_file.bnt```

### Features:
- first-class functions
- polymorphic functions
- product types as _type_ **Name** (non-recursive)
- _int_, _char_, _string_, _bool_, and _null_ primitive types
- standard arithmetic and boolean operations
- _List_ type
- _Tuple_ type
- built-in functions for: _List_ and _Tuple_ manipulation, basic I/O
- control-flow statements
- value case-switching
- static type-checking
- comments
- external file importing

### Features TODO:
- Built-in _string_ functions
- Type inference
- Sum types
- Recursive _type_'s
- Dependent types
